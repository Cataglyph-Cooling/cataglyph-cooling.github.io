  data: At Cata Cooling, we've developed a worker cooling service that provides a fleet of cooling vests for workers onsite. We provide freezer units, shown above, with vests for workers to stay cool throughout the entire day. Each worker is given cold vests so they can use one as another recharges. Each freezer unit provides and recharges enough cold vests for 5-10 workers. These units are highly mobile. They can be operated off of generators or plug-in power, and they are fitted with a trailer, fork lift slots for high mobility. A compact version can even fit on the bed of a pickup truck. We provide these units as a per-worker monthly subscription, so our customers only pay for what they need. We conduct regular freezer unit inspections to ensure vests and freezers are maintained.
